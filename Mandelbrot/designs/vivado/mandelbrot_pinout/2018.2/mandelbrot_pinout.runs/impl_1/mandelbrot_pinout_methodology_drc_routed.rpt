DSP FpgaUserCDxB.mandelBrot_computer_4/ZRe_step2/U0/i_synth/i_synth_option.i_synth_model/opt_7series.i_uniwrap/i_primitive input pin FpgaUserCDxB.mandelBrot_computer_4/ZRe_step2/U0/i_synth/i_synth_option.i_synth_model/opt_7series.i_uniwrap/i_primitive/B[5] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.
